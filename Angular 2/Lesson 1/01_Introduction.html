AngularJS extends HTML with new attributes.
AngularJS is perfect for Single Page Applications (SPAs).
You will learn the basics of AngularJS: directives, expressions, filters, modules, and controllers.
Then you will learn everything else you need to know about AngularJS: Events, DOM, Forms, Input, Validation, Http, and more.

What You Should Already Know
Before you study AngularJS, you should have a basic understanding of:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

AngularJS History
AngularJS version 1.0 was released in 2012.
MiÅ¡ko Hevery, a Google employee, started to work with AngularJS in 2009.
The idea turned out very well, and the project is now officially supported by Google.
-----------------------
AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. It can be added to an HTML page with a <script> tag.
AngularJS extends HTML attributes with Directives, and binds data to HTML with Expressions.

AngularJS is distributed as a JavaScript file, and can be added to a web page with a script tag:
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.4/angular.min.js"></script>

AngularJS Extends HTML
AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives.
The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.
The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.
The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title></title>
	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.4/angular.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<div ng-app>
	<p>Name: <input type="text" ng-model="name"></p>
	<p ng-bind="name"></p>
</div>


</body>
</html>

<!--
Example explained:
AngularJS starts automatically when the web page has loaded.
The ng-app directive tells AngularJS that the <div> element is the "owner" of an AngularJS application.
The ng-model directive binds the value of the input field to the application variable name.
The ng-bind directive binds the innerHTML of the <p> element to the application variable name.
