AngularJS expressions can be written inside double braces: {{ expression }}.
AngularJS expressions can also be written inside a directive: ng-bind="expression".
AngularJS will resolve the expression, and return the result exactly where the expression is written.
AngularJS expressions are much like JavaScript expressions: They can contain literals, operators, and variables.
Example {{ 5 + 5 }} or {{ firstName + " " + lastName }}
